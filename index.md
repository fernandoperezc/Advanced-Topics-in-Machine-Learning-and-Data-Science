# Objective

In this seminar, recent papers of the machine learning and data science literature are presented and discussed. Possible topics cover statistical models, machine learning algorithms and its applications.

The seminar “Advanced Topics in Machine Learning and Data Science” familiarizes students with recent developments in machine learning and data science. Recently published articles, as well as influential papers, have to be presented and critically reviewed. The students will learn how to structure a scientific presentation, which covers the motivation, key ideas and main results of a scientific paper. An important goal of the seminar presentation is to summarize the essential ideas of the paper in sufficient depth for the audience to be able to follow its main conclusion, especially why the article is (or is not) worth attention. The presentation style will play an important role and should reach the level of professional scientific presentations.
